# Asynchronous invocation<a name="invocation-async"></a>

* use cases
  * AWS services / -- invoke asynchronously -- Lambda functions -- to process -- events
    * Amazon S3
    * Amazon SNS
  * other ways, -- via --
    * AWS CLI
    * AWS SDK
* how does it work?
  * Lambda 
    * places the event | queue
    * if it's placed -> returns a success response WITHOUT additional information
  * separate process
    * reads events | queue
    * sends them -- to -- your function
  * if the function returns an error 
    * use cases
      * by the function's code
      * by the function's runtime (_Example:_ timeouts) 
    * -> by default, Lambda attempts to run it 2 more times / 
      * 1@ attempt -- 1 minute -- 2@ attempt
      * 2@ attempt -- 2 minutes -- 3@ attempt
* _Example1:_ AWS CLI / set `--invocation-type Event` (make async invocation)

    ```
    $ aws lambda invoke --function-name my-function  --invocation-type Event --payload '{ "key": "value" }' response.json
    {
      "StatusCode": 202
    }
    ```

    output file \(`response.json`\) does NOT contain ANY information, BUT STILL created

* _Example2:_ 
  * client / -- invoke asynchronously -- Lambda function
  * Lambda function -- queues the -- events | BEFORE sending them to the function

      ![\[\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images/features-async.png)

* concurrency
  * ðŸ‘€if the Lambda function does NOT have enough concurrency available to process all events -> ADDITIONAL requests are throttled ðŸ‘€
    * if throttling errors \(429\) or system errors \(500\-series\) -> Lambda
      * returns the event -- to the -- queue
      * retries
        * up to 6 hours
        * interval -- increases -- exponentially 
          * [1 second, < 5 minutes (if the queue is backed up -> longer) ]
    * see [blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/understanding-aws-lambdas-invoke-throttle-limits/)

* duplicated SAME event -- from -- Lambda
  * Reason: ðŸ§ the queue itself is eventually consistent ðŸ§ 
  * NOT necessary that function returns an error
  * if the function can NOT keep up with incoming events -> events / NOT sent to the function -- might be -- deleted
  * actions to take
    * your function code must gracefully handle duplicate events
    * enough concurrency -- to handle -- ALL invocations

## Configuring error handling -- for -- asynchronous invocation<a name="invocation-async-errors"></a>

* ways to proceed
  * send invocation records -- to a -- downstream resource
  * reduce the number of retries / Lambda performs
  * discard unprocessed events more quickly

* TODO:
Use the Lambda console to configure error handling settings on a function, a version, or an alias\.

**To configure error handling**

1. Open the Lambda console [Functions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/functions)\.

1. Choose a function\.

1. Under **Asynchronous invocation**, choose **Edit**\.

1. Configure the following settings\.
   + **Maximum age of event** â€“ The maximum amount of time Lambda retains an event in the asynchronous event queue, up to 6 hours\.
   + **Retry attempts** â€“ The number of times Lambda retries when the function returns an error, between 0 and 2\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

When an invocation event exceeds the maximum age or fails all retry attempts, Lambda discards it\. To retain a copy of discarded events, configure a failed\-event destination\.

## Configuring destinations for asynchronous invocation<a name="invocation-async-destinations"></a>


You can also configure Lambda to send an invocation record to another service\. Lambda supports the following [destinations](#invocation-async-destinations) for asynchronous invocation\.
+ **Amazon SQS** â€“ A standard SQS queue\.
+ **Amazon SNS** â€“ An SNS topic\.
+ **AWS Lambda** â€“ A Lambda function\.
+ **Amazon EventBridge** â€“ An EventBridge event bus\.

The invocation record contains details about the request and response in JSON format\. You can configure separate destinations for events that are processed successfully, and events that fail all processing attempts\. 

To send records of asynchronous invocations to another service, add a destination to your function\. You can configure separate destinations for events that fail processing and events that are successfully processed\. Like error handling settings, you can configure destinations on a function, a version, or an alias\.

The following example shows a function that is processing asynchronous invocations\. When the function returns a success response or exits without throwing an error, Lambda sends a record of the invocation to an EventBridge event bus\. When an event fails all processing attempts, Lambda sends an invocation record to an Amazon SQS queue\.

![\[\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images/features-destinations.png)

To send events to a destination, your function needs additional permissions\. Add a policy with the required permissions to your function's [execution role](lambda-intro-execution-role.md)\. Each destination service requires a different permission, as follows:
+ **Amazon SQS** â€“ [sqs:SendMessage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessage.html) 
+ **Amazon SNS** â€“ [sns:Publish](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Publish.html) 
+ **Lambda** â€“ [lambda:InvokeFunction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_Invoke.html)
+ **EventBridge** â€“ [events:PutEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_PutEvents.html)

Add destinations to your function in the Lambda console's function designer\.

**To configure a destination for asynchronous invocation records**

1. Open the Lambda console [Functions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/functions)\.

1. Choose a function\.

1. Under **Designer**, choose **Add destination**\.

1. For **Source**, choose **Asynchronous invocation**\.

1. For **Condition**, choose from the following options:
   + **On failure** â€“ Send a record when the event fails all processing attempts or exceeds the maximum age\.
   + **On success** â€“ Send a record when the function successfully processes an asynchronous invocation\.

1. For **Destination type**, choose the type of resource that receives the invocation record\.

1. For **Destination**, choose a resource\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

When an invocation matches the condition, Lambda sends a JSON document with details about the invocation to the destination\. The following example shows an invocation record for an event that failed three processing attempts due to a function error\.

**Example invocation record**  

```
{
    "version": "1.0",
    "timestamp": "2019-11-14T18:16:05.568Z",
    "requestContext": {
        "requestId": "e4b46cbf-b738-xmpl-8880-a18cdf61200e",
        "functionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:my-function:$LATEST",
        "condition": "RetriesExhausted",
        "approximateInvokeCount": 3
    },
    "requestPayload": {
        "ORDER_IDS": [
            "9e07af03-ce31-4ff3-xmpl-36dce652cb4f",
            "637de236-e7b2-464e-xmpl-baf57f86bb53",
            "a81ddca6-2c35-45c7-xmpl-c3a03a31ed15"
        ]
    },
    "responseContext": {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "executedVersion": "$LATEST",
        "functionError": "Unhandled"
    },
    "responsePayload": {
        "errorMessage": "RequestId: e4b46cbf-b738-xmpl-8880-a18cdf61200e Process exited before completing request"
    }
}
```

The invocation record contains details about the event, the response, and the reason that the record was sent\.

## Asynchronous invocation configuration API<a name="invocation-async-api"></a>

To manage asynchronous invocation settings with the AWS CLI or AWS SDK, use the following API operations\.
+ [PutFunctionEventInvokeConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_PutFunctionEventInvokeConfig.html)
+ [GetFunctionEventInvokeConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_GetFunctionEventInvokeConfig.html)
+ [UpdateFunctionEventInvokeConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_UpdateFunctionEventInvokeConfig.html)
+ [ListFunctionEventInvokeConfigs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_ListFunctionEventInvokeConfigs.html)
+ [DeleteFunctionEventInvokeConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_DeleteFunctionEventInvokeConfig.html)

To configure asynchronous invocation with the AWS CLI, use the `put-function-event-invoke-config` command\. The following example configures a function with a maximum event age of 1 hour and no retries\.

```
$ aws lambda put-function-event-invoke-config --function-name error \
--maximum-event-age-in-seconds 3600 --maximum-retry-attempts 0
{
    "LastModified": 1573686021.479,
    "FunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:error:$LATEST",
    "MaximumRetryAttempts": 0,
    "MaximumEventAgeInSeconds": 3600,
    "DestinationConfig": {
        "OnSuccess": {},
        "OnFailure": {}
    }
}
```

The `put-function-event-invoke-config` command overwrites any existing configuration on the function, version, or alias\. To configure an option without resetting others, use `update-function-event-invoke-config`\. The following example configures Lambda to send a record to an SQS queue named `destination` when an event can't be processed\.

```
$ aws lambda update-function-event-invoke-config --function-name error \
--destination-config '{"OnFailure":{"Destination": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-2:123456789012:destination"}}'
{
    "LastModified": 1573687896.493,
    "FunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:error:$LATEST",
    "MaximumRetryAttempts": 0,
    "MaximumEventAgeInSeconds": 3600,
    "DestinationConfig": {
        "OnSuccess": {},
        "OnFailure": {
            "Destination": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-2:123456789012:destination"
        }
    }
}
```

## AWS Lambda function dead\-letter queues<a name="dlq"></a>

As an alternative to an [on\-failure destination](#invocation-async-destinations), you can configure your function with a dead\-letter queue to save discarded events for further processing\. A dead\-letter queue acts the same as an on\-failure destination in that it is used when an event fails all processing attempts or expires without being processed\. However, a dead\-letter queue is part of a function's version\-specific configuration, so it is locked in when you publish a version\. On\-failure destinations also support additional targets and include details about the function's response in the invocation record\.

Alternatively, you can configure an SQS queue or SNS topic as a [dead\-letter queue](#dlq) for discarded events\. For dead\-letter queues, Lambda only sends the content of the event, without details about the response\.

If you don't have a queue or topic, create one\. Choose the target type that matches your use case\.
+ [Amazon SQS queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-create-queue.html) â€“ A queue holds failed events until they're retrieved\. You can retrieve events manually, or you can [configure Lambda to read from the queue](with-sqs.md) and invoke a function\.

  Create a queue in the [Amazon SQS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs)\.
+ [Amazon SNS topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/gsg/CreateTopic.html) â€“ A topic relays failed events to one or more destinations\. You can configure a topic to send events to an email address, a Lambda function, or an HTTP endpoint\.

  Create a topic in the [Amazon SNS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/home)\.

To send events to a queue or topic, your function needs additional permissions\. Add a policy with the required permissions to your function's [execution role](lambda-intro-execution-role.md)\.
+ **Amazon SQS** â€“ [sqs:SendMessage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessage.html) 
+ **Amazon SNS** â€“ [sns:Publish](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Publish.html) 

If the target queue or topic is encrypted with a customer managed key, the execution role must also be a user in the key's [resource\-based policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html)\.

After creating the target and updating your function's execution role, add the dead\-letter queue to your function\. You can configure multiple functions to send events to the same target\.

**To configure a dead\-letter queue**

1. Open the Lambda console [Functions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/functions)\.

1. Choose a function\.

1. Under **Asynchronous invocation**, choose **Edit**\.

1. Set **DLQ resource** to **Amazon SQS** or **Amazon SNS**\.

1. Choose the target queue or topic\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

To configure a dead\-letter queue with the AWS CLI, use the `update-function-configuration` command\.

```
$ aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name my-function \
--dead-letter-config TargetArn=arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:my-topic
```

Lambda sends the event to the dead\-letter queue as\-is, with additional information in attributes\. You can use this information to identify the error that the function returned, or to correlate the event with logs or an AWS X\-Ray trace\.

**Dead\-letter queue message attributes**
+ **RequestID** \(String\) â€“ The ID of the invocation request\. Request IDs appear in function logs\. You can also use the X\-Ray SDK to record the request ID on an attribute in the trace\. You can then search for traces by request ID in the X\-Ray console\. For an example, see the [error processor sample](samples-errorprocessor.md)\.
+ **ErrorCode** \(Number\) â€“ The HTTP status code\.
+ **ErrorMessage** \(String\) â€“ The first 1 KB of the error message\.

![\[\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images/invocation-dlq-attributes.png)

If Lambda can't send a message to the dead\-letter queue, it deletes the event and emits the [DeadLetterErrors](monitoring-metrics.md) metric\. This can happen because of lack of permissions, or if the total size of the message exceeds the limit for the target queue or topic\. For example, if an Amazon SNS notification with a body close to 256 KB triggers a function that results in an error, the additional event data added by Amazon SNS, combined with the attributes added by Lambda, can cause the message to exceed the maximum size allowed in the dead\-letter queue\. 

If you're using Amazon SQS as an event source, configure a dead\-letter queue on the Amazon SQS queue itself and not on the Lambda function\. For more information, see [Using AWS Lambda with Amazon SQS](with-sqs.md)\.
